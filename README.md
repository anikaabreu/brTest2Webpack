# backbone-webpack
Skeleton for a backbone app that uses webpack instead of requirejs

This project provides the minimal implementation of a backbone application packaged with WebPack. The main container element into which
the application will be placed is currently #fiddle-app. It appears twice in main.js. Replace it with the selector for your application's 
containing element.
